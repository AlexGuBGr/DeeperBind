# DeeperBind: DeeperBind: Enhancing Prediction of Sequence Specificities of DNA Binding Proteins
DeeperBind is an extension of [DeepBind](http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v33/n8/full/nbt.3300.html) which adds a layer of Deep LSTM to model positional information. DeepBind is deisgned to predict protein-DNA binding affinity from high-throughput assays that measure the binding affinity.
